# AMETHYST


A note from the author:

> hello! This is my repository for implementing a ray tracer in C++. It's largely based off the PBRT-v3 renderer. I'm implementing it as I go reading through the chapters. Once I implement a chunk of code within a chapter, I'll go print the next one off at work. Apologies to my manager / the earth.
